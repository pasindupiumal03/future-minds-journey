                        <p>Families and communities are increasingly affected by climate change and natural disasters, such as heat waves, floods, and bushfires. Particularly for young children who growth requirements depend on secure environments and responsive connections, these crises can result in psychological suffering, disruptions to routines, displacement, and property loss (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022).</p>
                        <p>Addressing such circumstances is essential in early childhood education because teachers are essential in ensuring safety, continuity, and emotional support both during and after crises. Predictable routines and trauma-informed care are necessary since children may express trauma through play or behaviour (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022).</p>
                        <p>Sociological theories that highlight how crises like natural disasters affect children across interrelated systems from the close family to the larger society include Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory. Children's development, safety, and well-being are all impacted when these layers are disturbed. Recent studies (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022) emphasise how vulnerable children are and advocate for trauma-informed, inclusive practices in early childhood settings, including culturally sensitive disaster planning, educator readiness, and emotional support.</p>
                        <p>The issue in Australia is changing as a result of more climate-related disasters. Different socioeconomic backgrounds, cultural norms, and geographic locations all influence how diverse populations experience crises, necessitating customised, culturally sensitive responses from providers and educators (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022).</p>

                        <p>Children's growth, learning, wellbeing, relationships, and involvement can all be greatly impacted by crisis and emergency situations like natural disasters, displacement, or domestic abuse. A child's feeling of security and stability may be weakened by these occurrences, which frequently lead to emotional trauma, relocation, and disturbed routines. Children's cognitive and social development may be directly impacted by increased anxiety, behavioural abnormalities, and challenges with emotional regulation (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022).</p>
                        <p>The delivery of early childhood services must change to assist families and their children both during and after these occasions. Services are essential in providing stable, secure, and predictable settings where children may recover their routines and confidence. Emotional support techniques, adaptable planning, and sensitive communication are all crucial components of trauma-informed therapy. Educators must also interact with families in a kind way, acknowledging their various educational and cultural settings. To ensure that services can efficiently and fairly address children's needs during emergencies, inclusive disaster preparedness, professional training, and community cooperation are required (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022).</p>

                    <p>The National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework and the National Strategy for Disaster Resilience are important national and state policies that manage crises and provide guidance for resilience-building and coordinated emergency responses. State-level programmes, like Victoria's Emergency Management Framework, prioritise readiness, response, and recovery, giving particular attention to children and other vulnerable populations (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022).</p>

                    <p>By encouraging trauma-informed, culturally sensitive care and including resilience-building techniques into programmes, policy interventions have an impact on early childhood practices. By using a socio-ecological framework, policies recognise children's different skills and cultural backgrounds while promoting their roles as active participants in recovery. In order to meet different needs and promote safety, hope, and connection, a stepped care approach that offers graduated levels of support can enhance mental health and wellbeing results (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022). After an emergency, educators may create inclusive, supportive learning environments with the help of this comprehensive policy framework.</p>

By modifying materials, environments, and communication to accommodate a range of needs, educators can also incorporate eco-friendly practices, problem-solving exercises, and safety drills into daily routines, ensuring inclusion for children who are at risk (Chavez Marinkovic et al., 2022).</p>
